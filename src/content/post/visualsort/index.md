## Demo

Check out the VisualSort demo [**here**](/programs/visualsort)!

## Introduction

I saw a video on Youtube about visualizing sorting algorithms and became inspired to make them myself. So I did. Visual Sort is a program will let you visualize different sorting algorithms and generate beautiful videos along with sound. I used matplotlib to create the bargraphs and ffmpeg to create the video. This is a good way of seeing how the algorithms work to sort data and will help the user learn more by being able to peer into the inner workings.

## VisualSort

VisualSort allows you to visualize 15+ different algorithms:

- Bogo Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Cocktail Shaker Sort
- Comb Sort
- Counting Sort
- Gnome Sort
- Insertion Sort (2)
- Merge Sort (subarrays)
- Merge Sort (in place)
- Pigeonhole Sort
- Quick Sort
- Quick Sort (LR ptrs)
- Radix Sort
- Selection Sort
- Shell Sort
- Tim Sort

It is written in python and is very easy to use!

To get started, take a look at the installation instructions and guide on my [repo](https://github.com/SauravC99/VisualSort).
